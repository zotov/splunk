1. Add file -> add to index
2. commit -> pull -> push up to stream
3. revert to revision
   3.1 menu -> replace with previous revision
   3.2 History -> Revert Commit 
4.make new branch -> push branch


#ignore to commit
to leave the file in the repo but ignore future changes to it:

git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>
and to undo this:

git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>
to find out which files have been set this way:

git ls-files -v|grep '^h'

#checkout branch
git checkout -b master --track origin/master

#revert marge
git merge --abort
git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD


#revert previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1

--soft indicates that the uncommitted files should be retained as working files opposed to --hard which would discard them.
HEAD~1 is the last commit. If you want to rollback 3 commits you could use HEAD~3. If you want to rollback to a specific revision number, you could also do that using its SHA hash.


#remove file from repository but not remove from folder
git rm --cached -r mydirectory

#remove file from unstaged changes
git reset HEAD filepath
